# Welcome to CliMATES
**We are MATES fighting CLIMATE CHANGE!**
This app allows users to track how much water, carbon, and energy they are wasting to help become of the growing community fighting global warming!

## Inspiration 💡
With the growing number of floods, heat strokes, ice melting stories, and more climate change stories occuring more and more frequently, I found it imperative that I help users understand how their every day decisions makes an impact large scale. After much research for an existing solution, I found no website or app that addresses water, energy, and carbon saving simply and efficiently in one website. I was determined to make the change!

## What it does 💻
CliMATES allows users to track how much water, energy, and carbon they are using on a weekly or monthly basis and uses those numbers to generate a graph that visually represents this trend after 20 years. They are allowed to compare this to the average household to help them become more efficient!

## How I built it 🔧
For graphic design and video production, I used
* Adobe Illustrator
* Adobe Premiere Pro

I built the website using
* Typescript
* React
* SCSS

And deployed the website onto
* Netlify

To generate the graphs, we use CanvasJS. These tools combine for a easy to use, dynamic website for users!

## Challenges I ran into 🤔
Since I challenged myself to create this application in a day's worth of time, the time limit was a bit pressurizing. However, it also motivated me to find solutions instead of giving up!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 😁
I'm proud that
* I could develop a dynamic webpage with an easy user interface
* Complete this website in a day's time
* Use Typescript and SCSS to its fullest extent
* Learn new skills!

## What I learned ⭐
I learned how to
* Use Typescript features such as UseState and type binding
* Use CanvasJS to generate graphs
* Design a user-friendly interface

## What's next for CliMATES 🎯
I have many goals for CliMATES!
* Track how users are saving money over time
* Add more tracking tabs
* Implement accounts: goals, compete with friends, and more!
With all these features, CliMATES can truly become a connected platform that takes perserving steps towards ending global warming and saving our planet!
